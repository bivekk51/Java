# Java Program to Illustrate Creating and Importing Packages

In this program, we will break the task into two parts:
1. **Creating a Package**: We will create a simple package `shapes` with a class `Circle` that computes the area of a circle.
2. **Using the Package**: We will create a main class `ShapeDemo` in a different package and import the `shapes` package to use the `Circle` class.

### Step 1: Create the `shapes` Package

Create a folder structure for the `shapes` package. For example, if you're working in a directory like `/src`, create a folder `/src/shapes/` to hold the class `Circle`.

Create the `Circle.java` file in the `shapes` package:

#### `Circle.java` (inside the `shapes` package)

```java
package shapes;

public class Circle {
    private double radius;

    // Constructor to initialize radius
    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    // Method to calculate area of the circle
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create the `ShapeDemo` Class to Use the `Circle` Package

Now, create the main class `ShapeDemo` in a different package or default package, which imports the `shapes` package and uses the `Circle` class.

#### `ShapeDemo.java`

```java
// Import the shapes package to use the Circle class
import shapes.Circle;

public class ShapeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of Circle class from shapes package
        Circle circle = new Circle(5.0);
        
        // Calculate and display the area of the circle
        System.out.println("Area of the circle: " + circle.area());
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Creating a Package**:
   - The package `shapes` is created using the `package` keyword at the top of the `Circle.java` file.
   - The `Circle` class has a constructor to initialize the radius and a method `area()` to calculate the area using the formula `π * r^2`.

2. **Importing the Package**:
   - In the `ShapeDemo.java` file, we import the `Circle` class from the `shapes` package using the `import` keyword.
   - We then create an instance of `Circle` with a radius of `5.0` and call the `area()` method to calculate and display the area of the circle.

3. **Folder Structure**:
   - In a project directory, the folder structure will look like this:
     ```
     src/
     ├── shapes/
     │   └── Circle.java
     └── ShapeDemo.java
     ```

4. **Compiling and Running**:
   - To compile the program, you must first navigate to the `src` directory in the terminal and compile the `Circle` and `ShapeDemo` classes:
     ```bash
     javac shapes/Circle.java ShapeDemo.java
     ```
   - To run the `ShapeDemo` class, use:
     ```bash
     java ShapeDemo
     ```

### Output:

```
Area of the circle: 78.53981633974483
```

This program demonstrates how to create a package (`shapes`), place a class (`Circle`) inside it, and then import and use that class in another Java class (`ShapeDemo`).
